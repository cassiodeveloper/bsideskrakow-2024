<h1 class="title">About</h1>

<p>BSides Kraków is an International InfoSec conference organized by the community.</p>
<p>BSides events combine security expertise from a variety of platforms in search of the “next big thing” in information security. BSides is an open platform that gives security experts and indus-try professionals the opportunity so share ideas, insights, and develop longstanding relationships with others in the community. It is a rare opportunity to directly connect and create trusted rela-tionships with key members of the community.</p>

<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>

<p>BSides events combine security expertise from a variety of platforms in search of the “next big thing” in information security. BSides is an open platform that gives security experts and indus-try professionals the opportunity so share ideas, insights, and develop longstanding relationships with others in the community. It is a rare opportunity to directly connect and create trusted rela-tionships with key members of the community.</p>

<h2 id="not">What BSides is not</h2>

<p>BSides does not compete with any other event. The goal has and always will be to expand the spectrum of conversation and enable a greater variety of events. Certainly one can take the business perspective and say that any and every security conference competes with each other, but this would ignore the fact that these events are traditionally FREE and simply offer people another alternative to everything else.</p>
<p>BSides is not the All-Conference-Rejects. Certainly the idea may have sparked after the organizer and others got rejected from a conference submission, but the goal in creating Security BSides is always to enable a greater variety of conversation. We do not want speakers who are talking about the current big thing, we want to find new talent who are discussing the NEXT BIG THING!</p>

<h2 id="objectives"></h2>

<p>Major conferences focus on the current hot topics in information security. BSides events explore the fringe of con-versation and focus on the Next Big Thing. The conversation has ranged from hardware hacking to gender issues, from twitter hacking to proximity-based identity theft. BSides gives voice to the conversation that is happening just below the surface.</p>
