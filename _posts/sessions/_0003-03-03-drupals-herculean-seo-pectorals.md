Ascend to SEO demigodhood with Drupal 7 and an all-star cast of community contributed modules. In this crash course, you will learn how to make Drupal sing sweet music to the almighty Googlebot. Prepare to walk away with a powerful set of SEO tactics and best practices.

### Session Highlights

* Twenty modules covered (yep, 20, all wondrous)
* Which meta tags are valuable, which are not
* Make sense of .htaccess and robots.txt
* The correct way to use headings 1-6

### Plus!

* Semantic blocks
* Advanced front-end performance
* Web-accessible "take home" reference guide

This session will not teach you how to write quality content. It will demonstrate how to use Drupal to present your content the way Google prefers. Drupal beginners will likely gain the most. Intermediate site builders who haven't dabbled deeply into SEO will have much to gain, as well.

Mega thanks to the talented developers of the Drupal community whose efforts have made Drupal into the best platform for SEO.

Rememberâ€¦ the advantage is not unfair if you use your powers for good.
