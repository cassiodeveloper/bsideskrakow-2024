---

On Friday 13/09, we're wrapping up the first day of the conference with our first ever Meet the keynote speakers! But, how does it work?

We will prepare a place where you can meet face-to-face the keynote speakers for an informal chat meeting.

It's an amazing opportunity for you to get some extra knowledge from our speakers and of course, engage with the community even more. One of them might have the answer for you project, research, problem or even your next step on your career.

## How it works

**We have very limited spot for that**
There is a minimum number of 10 participants :)

**You must register in advance**
You need to register in advance. Since we have limited spots it's not possible to just "let you in".

**Walk-ins won't be welcome!**
If you haven't made up your mind and register on time, do not show up at the meeting... unfortunatelly we have limited spots.

**Bring your questions!**
To make the time even more productive, prepare your questions in advance to ask / talk to our guests.

We hope to see you there!

And seriously, feel free to RSVP.
