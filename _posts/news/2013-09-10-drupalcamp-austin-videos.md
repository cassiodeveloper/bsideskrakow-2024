One last update for BSides Kraków 2013. We've had the videos online for a while but forgot to embed them into each session page. Our apologies and thanks to the [Houston DUG](https://groups.drupal.org/houston-texas) for the reminder to get them online :)

Each session detail page has its video embedded. The easiest way to find a particular video is by [browsing the schedule](/schedule/), then clicking on the session you want to watch. There is also a [Youtube playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL42rSVhWmWRtydBksnU16IszNR7J58cnH) with all the videos, thanks to Lanette Miller for putting it together.
