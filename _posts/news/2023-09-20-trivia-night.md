On Friday 13/09, we're wrapping up the first day of the camp with our first ever Geek Trivia Night! But, how does it work?

If you've ever watched any TV show that is based on questions and answers you know what we are talking about, just well, our trivia night is *not* like that, because the questions aren't about general stuff.

Instead, Geek Trivia Night will test your overall knowledge on a variety of topics around IT, InfoSec and such. It's basically a quiz on things you *actually* know -- plus awesome prizes.

## How it works

**All teams must be a maximum of 3 people.**
There is no minimum number for a team, unless that number is 0 because you're not here :)

**Teams are registered at trivia night**
You do not need to register your team in advance. Team names will be registered once trivia starts. Do arrive a little early to pick a good spot!

**Walk-ins will be welcome!**
If you haven't made up your mind, do know walk-ins for trivia will be welcome, space permitting.

**Bring your friends!**
Though Geek Trivia Night is brought to you by BSides Krak√≥w, everyone is welcome! Bring your non-InfoSec friends and show them how cool our community is!

## Prizes

The following companies have generously agreed to donate prizes for trivia night: <a href="http://hak5.org/" target="_blank">HAK5</a> and TBD.

We hope to see you there!

And seriously, feel free to RSVP, even if your team is not full yet.
