On Friday 13/09 after the conference, we're wrapping up the after party! But, how does it work?

Right after the conference around 19h, in a place that will be disclosured ONLY AT THE END of the conference, we will meet our guests for food, drinks and music.

## How it works

**Start at 19h and finish at 1AM**
You will houve vouchers to spend durign the party, don't worry. (Unless they end.)

**No need for registration**
But your badge is your ticket, no badge no voucher to the party!

**Walk-ins will be welcome!**
If you haven't made up your mind, do know walk-ins for the party will be welcome, but you won't have badge so you pay for yourself.

**Bring your friends!**
Same rule for the walk-in.

## Prizes

The following companies have generously agreed to donate prizes for the after party: <a href="http://hak5.org/" target="_blank">HAK5</a> and TBD.

We hope to see you there!
