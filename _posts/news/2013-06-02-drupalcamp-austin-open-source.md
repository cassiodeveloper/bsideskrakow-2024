We're continuing to experiment with the BSides Krak贸w website, so we're excited to announce that we've open sourced the whole thing!

Why bother doing this? Well, it means that as of right now **YOU can make any change to the site** that you want. This certainly isn't the first time a conference has done this, but we like the idea and think the site should be in the hands of the entire community rather than just a few organizers. Go nuts!

### How can I make a change?

[The repository is available on GitHub](https://github.com/fourkitchens/dca2013) so if you're comfy with GitHub Pull Requests, feel free to clone and send a PR our way. If you need some help GitHub has some great docs that walk through the process:
